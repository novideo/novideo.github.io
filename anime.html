                This is some of my favorite anime of all time. I haven't been watching anime 
                for that long, with my first one being a Studio Ghibli film (Spirited Away). 
                The genres I enjoy watching are usually drama, action, and comedy.
            </p>

            <p>
                Note: the reviews
                will cover the entire series, not just the specific TV series/movie/ONA
            </p>

            <p>
                You can find my entire anime list which is on <a href="https://anilist.co/user/novideo" target="blank">AniList</a>.

            <h2>#1: Evangelion</h2>

            </figure>
            <p>
                This is hands down my favorite anime of all time. Sure there are plenty of mecha anime out  
                there including Darling in the FranXX and Code Geass which are very good, but Evangelion has a 
                unique psychological factor that makes it stand out. There are a lot of talks relating to the 
                ambiguity of the show, but I think this is the beauty of it. It allows for the watcher to 
                think and interpret for themselves what the show really means. This accompanied by the OST composed mostly by 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shir%C5%8D_Sagisu" target="blank">Shiro SAGISU</a> really makes it an amazing 
                show. Also, I appreciate the use of classical works from Bach and Beethoven. The baroque and classical 
                works they included really suited the show. It's a really minor detail, but it really does make people 
                especially classical music enjoyers appreciate the show. 
            </p>

            <h2>#2: Gintama</h2>
            <figure>
                <a href="https://anilist.co/anime/918/Gintama/" target="blank">
                    <img src="https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/media/anime/cover/large/bx918-hRbQHIkRUebX.jpg">
                </a>
                <figcaption>Gintama cover</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                "Gintama??? Why is this second? It's just one of those shows with 90% filler and no plot, right?"
            </p>
            <p>
                ... is what I thought too. However, there's more to it than that. Behind the comedy of Gintama is 
                a great story that describes each character in great detail, especially the main characters. 
                Most of the arcs introduce the watcher to a new character and their lore. This allows the watcher 
                to develop a great understanding and connection to each of the characters. Finally, all of this 
                comes back to the watcher when they start the Shogun Assassination arc.
            </p>
            <p>
                Gintama usually isn't an anime I'd recommend to friends, joking aside. These days, I can't even 
                finish <b>Ya Boi Kongming</b> without taking four months. However, if you have the patience, want 
                to watch something comedic, sad, and with amazing lore, Gintama might be for you.
